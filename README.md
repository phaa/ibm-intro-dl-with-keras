## About the Course  
This course introduces the fundamentals of neural networks and deep learning, covering perceptrons, neural networks, and their various applications.  
Throughout the course, supervised models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are explored, as well as unsupervised models like autoencoders and Restricted Boltzmann Machines.  
Since the course lectures and labs are in English, all code has been kept in the same language for consistency.

## Repository Structure  
The Jupyter notebook files are organized by modules, following the course structure:  

```

It demonstrates the application of concepts learned throughout the course to classify aircraft damage using Convolutional Neural Networks, as well as describe images using Transformer-based models.

## How to Use  

1. Clone and access the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/phaa/ibm-intro-dl-with-keras.git
   cd ibm-ml-with-python/
   ```
2. Activate your virtual environment (conda or venv):  
   ```bash
   conda activate ibmenv
   ```
3. Run the notebooks with Jupyter Lab:  
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
   
*Each notebook contains a cell with the necessary dependency installations.*
